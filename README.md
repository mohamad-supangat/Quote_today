#Soul Eater
##Black Star

The tattoo is a symbol of my family, the Star Clan. They were a clan of assassins. Everybody knew they would do anything for money. After a while killing people wasn't enough, they were hungry for even more power so they began hunting human souls. But now it's just me, I'm the last member of the Star Clan. 13 years ago their souls were taken by Lord Death and the Meisters from the Academy. At the time I was still a baby, so they didn't take my soul. That's when the school took me in. That's it. The end.
