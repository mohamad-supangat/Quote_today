# Sousei no Aquarion

Toma Epanort

On that day twelve thousand years ago, on the summit of clouds reaching the stratosphere, remember that evening when we watched the prominence rise from the sunspot together…
Entrusting our bodies to the Earth’s love, we listened carefully to the memories of the sea etched in every droplet of the falling rain that morning. When we looked up at the ocean’s singers who had gathered at the swaying great temple, the voices of prayer…
That day, under the Tree of Life, we entrusted the beginning of the world to those reverberations… Remember that brilliance.
